## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Angel Medina Rodas!

A self-taught aspiring Backend Web Developer with a background in art and design.

### About Me

I'm a passionate individual with a diverse background in illustration, graphic design, and a lifelong interest in programming. Now entering my 30s, I'm committed to achieving my goal of becoming a skilled backend web developer.  My autodidactic nature has driven me to explore various aspects of technology, and I'm now fully focused on building robust and efficient web applications. I believe my creative background gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving and software development.

### Currently Working On

I'm currently developing a unique image gallery application using **Python**, **PyQt5**, and **SQLite**. This project is born from a personal need I identified during my time as an illustrator: a gallery with powerful search and filtering capabilities, including positive and negative filters.  The goal is to create a tool that truly streamlines the workflow for artists and designers.

### Currently Learning

I'm focusing on strengthening my fundamentals in **Testing** and **Design Patterns**. A strong foundation in these areas is crucial for writing maintainable, scalable, and reliable code.

### Looking to Collaborate On

I'm eager to collaborate on web development projects! My primary goal is to learn and gain experience, and I'm not focused on monetary compensation at this stage. I'm open to contributing my skills and enthusiasm to projects where I can learn from experienced developers and contribute to meaningful solutions.
